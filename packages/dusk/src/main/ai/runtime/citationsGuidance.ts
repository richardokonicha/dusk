Results from ${tools} each carry an \`id\` field. When a statement in your reply is based on one of those results, append a citation marker immediately after it: [cite:ID] with the exact id (e.g. "Prices rose 3% in June. [cite:3f2a1b9c-2]"). Chain markers when several results support one statement: [cite:3f2a1b9c-1][cite:7d4e0a51-3]. Copy ids exactly — never invent or renumber them — and do not add a "References" or "Sources" section: the app renders citations from the inline markers.`
